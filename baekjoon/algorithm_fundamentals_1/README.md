Algorithm Fundamentals 1
=================

- Learn more about Stack. Using a problem using a stack, learn what properties of the stack can be used to solve the problem. Queue and Deque are only introduced in this chapter. Both data structures will be intensively covered in the Graphs and BFS chapters.
- Learn the basic math content needed to solve problems. Learn about remainder operations, greatest common divisor, and prime numbers.
- Understand what dynamic programming is and use the least difficult problems to understand dynamic programming.
